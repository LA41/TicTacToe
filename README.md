# TicTacToe
Rules of this game are pretty simple: user plays against computer, and after each move app checks whether any of players have won or if it's a tie. User gets asked in which position from 1 to 9 would he/she like to play, and then computers responds to it with brief info which position it chose. App also checks if user would like to play the position that is already taken - if so, the message "invalid move" prompts on a screen and user gets asked again, unitl provides a valid number.

Thing I learned with this project is definitely extracting methods, what definitely saves time and brainpower. Also I got more practice with clean code. One of the methods is hard-coded, and my plan for the future is to learn how to clean stuff like this a bit.
